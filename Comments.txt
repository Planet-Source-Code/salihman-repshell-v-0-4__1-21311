Here's RepShell v0.4 (about time or I will never
reach v 1.0). For the first time its really 
usable for users with little computer knowledge.
As always the Exe is included in the zip, all 
you need is the VB6 Runtime dlls. If you don't 
have this, I am planning a website for RepShell 
where you can also download the total setup 
package. But in the meantime you can download 
it from Microsoft.

	      REMARKS
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
RECOMMENDED SCREEN RES : I developed RepShell in
1024*768, but actually there are no screen limits.
If your screen res is to low, it looks crappy, but
so does everthing else, including explorer.

DUE TO ALL KINDS OF SMALL THINGS, NOT COMPATIBLE 
WITH WINNT/2000. I'LL TRY TO FIX THIS SOON

AFTER CHANGING THE WALLPAPER FROM WINDOWS SCREEN
PROPERTIES, PRESS F5 TO REFRESH DESKTOP.

THE SPECIAL BALLOON TOOLTIP DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK
IN THE EXECUTABLE.

PLEASE RUN RunMeFirst.bat before trying to run 
RepShell. This is a batch file that registers 
the controls and dll used by RepShell.

LOOP HOLE IF YOU GET STUCK: PRESS CTRL + SHIFT + 
Right Click the systray to start explorer.

'GET STARTED: Some hotkeys and functions
    RightClick My computer Icon to get a menu
    Right click desktop
    Key F5 to refresh desktop
    Ctrl+Alt+A      : End the program
    Windows key + S : Show Start Menu on mouse 
		      position

    'ONLY WORK IF REPSHELL IS DEFAULT SHELL
    Windows key + F : Show Favorites menu at 
    		      mouse position
    Windows key + R : Show RunDialog
    'END ONLY WORK IF REPSHELL IS DEFAULT SHELL

    Popupmenu button on keyboard can also be used
    You can use the arrowkeys for desktop icon 
    navigation and menu nav

The changes in this update are

     * Renaming is working perfectly, clicking 
       antything else will be "felt" and renaming 
       will be completed
     * Removed QuickExplorer, instead I am searching 
       for a way to start explorer without starting 
       the explorer shell
     * FIXED : When you click space between Desktop 
               icon and label it is now also selected
     * ADDED : Now able to choose menu font
     * ADDED : function to minimize taskbox, so only 
	       taskicons are visible
     * FIXED : Menu width, wasn't calculated right
     * DESIGN : Menus are rounded
     * ADDED : Now run startup programs, links in 
	       startup folder and even in registry
               But only if repshell is default shell, 
	       so this won't bug you if you're just testing
     * FIXED : Quickicons are drawn correctly
     * ADDED : Now a standard icon is shown in the 
	       taskbox if a window has no icon
     * FIXED : Sometimes the desktopicon labels were to 
	       big (height) for the text in them, no more
	       Width is still to big sometimes
     * ADDED : Now detects screen res change and resizes 
	       accordingly (still buggy)
     * FIXED : Menu arrow navigation, when reached it 
	       end of list, it didn't go back up
     * ADDED : Special balloon tooltip to show connection 
	       properties. But only works in Shell for the 
 	       moment, rarel in the exe
     * ADDED : FINALLY FOUND A WAY TO LETMENU UNLOAD ITSELF IF 
	       IT LOSES FOCUS
     * FIXED : A GIANT MEMORY LEAK IN MENUDRAWING FUNTION,
               THAT CAUSED REPSHELL TO CRASH AFTER A COUPLE
               OF USES OF THE MENUSYSTEM
     * DESIGN : to form background we take the wallpaper (set 
                in screen-properties), and make it transparent
                if neccesary
     * ADDED : Option to load standard settings file into memory
     * FIXED : After renaming the recyclebin, it's link wouldn't work
     * DESIGN : Redesigned options form
     * ADDED : Option to choose which of the quickicons you 
	       want to show, if any
     * FIXED : Computer crashed when RepShell was default shell
     * FIXED : In menu when moved from folder to non-folder 
	       item, a new submenu was shown on non-folder item
     * FIXED : Taskbuttons which had focus, didn't redraw correctly
	       until you moved over it.

Features:   - Fully enabled taskbox with cool buttons
	    - In systemmenus added option "Always On Top"
	      to every window, which is automaticall detected
	      Menu is only visible from RepShell Taskbox

	    - Direct access to all folders
            - Context menus for desktop items 
            - Arrow navigation on desktop and in menus
	    - Choose your own colors for menus 
      	    - Very fast file searching
            - Ability to make RepShell default shell from the option form
	    - Option form to change a lot of settings
            - Working desktop refreshing
	    - Added item to context menu of desktopitems to rename them, 
	      this is not a standard windows function 
            - Simple DUN functions

WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT IN THE NEXT VERSION?
	- Optimized Systray
	- Scrolling in menus, if the are larger then screen
	- Enabling online time
	- More animated buttons, maybe make the folder items 
	  on desktop animated
	- Adding the options, to change taskbutton colors from
 	  option screen.
 	- Any suggestions?

Even if you don't like the program there's a lot you can 
learn from here. And I really mean a lot. It's up to you 
guys to fully test it. Please leave comments.

If you're an experienced programmer please contact me,
i've been having some problems, maybe you can help me
out.
